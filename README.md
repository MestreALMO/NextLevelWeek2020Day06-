# Next Level Week 2020 Day 06 +

This is the code I did in the fist day of Next Level Week 2020.
![NLW2020](https://github.com/MestreALMO/NextLevelWeek2020Day01/blob/master/NLW_wallpapers/1%20-%20NLW%20%2302%20-%201400x900.jpg?raw=true)
But What is the Next level week? It is a event with a lot of code, learning, challenges, networking and getting the participants to the next level. The event is in portuguese, so I'm translating everything and showing how the things are happening.

This code has as objective build a code that can open as app and web:
Here is how it should look like when the app is done:
![NLW2020App](https://github.com/MestreALMO/NextLevelWeek2020Day01/blob/master/ReadmeImgs/AppObjective.png?raw=true)
And here is how the web should be when done:
![NLW2020App](https://github.com/MestreALMO/NextLevelWeek2020Day01/blob/master/ReadmeImgs/WebObjective.png?raw=true)

<br />-----<br />

This is the extra steps, what it is recommended to add in the app:

What it is recommended to add in the web:
![NLW2020App](https://github.com/MestreALMO/NextLevelWeek2020Day06Plus/blob/master/_ReadmeImgs/Screenshot_2.png?raw=true)

The extra steps are going to be done by me without help and there is not a date to finish, i can always add something else when and if I feel the need to. So this is called the day 6 +, cause of that is everything of the day six and after.
